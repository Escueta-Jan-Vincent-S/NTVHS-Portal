Student
- Can View

Other:
- Homepage (Done, can add features)
- Database (Connected, can be update anytime)

Recommendations:
- Manage Quiz, add feature were when time is done, it will turn red as the date of end of activity is done and no one can now access except only admin.
- Add text shadows to all of the text

FIX:

command:
we will do the library management, but this time it is the same as video but its a full of books.

So, the admin will fill this
* Title of book
* Description
* Grade
* Upload pdf
* Picture (optional)

so in the view thingy you will show the picture if they uploaded it, and if not, just put no picture
